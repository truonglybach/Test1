# Test1
I'm making this as a test. To get the GitHub Flow.
I want to learn how to use GitHub in order to complete my goals.
I've made many mistakes and I'm still learning how to accept them.
I'm actively looking within myself to force myself to face them.
I need to learn, not only how to program, but even more about myself in order to make my business a reality.
I need to grow as a person and practice the lessons that I've learned, even if they're the most stupid mistakes in the world.
